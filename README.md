## 👋 Hello!

⚙️ I'm Ruby, an incoming student at the University of British Columbia studying engineering. 
<br>
🎨 Art and design is practically in my bones and guides everything I do! From organizing the coolest (if I may say so myself) hackathons to pursuing my degree, I'm always bringing my art into what I do. 

🌱 **Currently,** I'm spending my summer organizing [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/), the world's first hackathon on an island and exploring software and hardware by building.

### Get in Touch!
📫 I'm always open to new opportunities or for a chat, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruby-ke/) or reach out to me at rubyjke@gmail.com!
