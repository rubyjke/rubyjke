## 👋 Hello!

⚙️ I'm Ruby, a student at the University of British Columbia studying engineering. 
<br>
🎨 Art and design is practically in my bones and guides everything I do! From organizing the coolest (if I may say so myself) hackathons to pursuing my degree, I'm always bringing my art into what I do. 

💻 One of my favourite things to do is to organize hackathons! Some I've been involved with have been [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/), [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/), and [JAMHacks 9](https://www.jamhacks.ca/)!
