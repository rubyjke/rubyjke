## 👋 Hello!

⚙️ I'm Ruby, a student at the University of British Columbia studying engineering. 
<br>
🎨 Art and design is practically in my bones and guides everything I do! From organizing the coolest (if I may say so myself) hackathons to pursuing my degree, I'm always bringing my art into what I do.
